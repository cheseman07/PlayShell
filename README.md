# PlayShell
a XMB style frontend into an emulator (most likely just PS3) I'm creating as a personal project, i will attempt to utilise python and pygame first, but at a later date i will attempt to utilise C++ or even C# for greater efficiency.

i will attempt to keep a log of my thought process in LOG.md
